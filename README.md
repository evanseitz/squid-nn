**SQUID** (**S**urrogate **Qu**antitative **I**nterpretability for **D**eepnets) is a Python suite to interpret sequence-based deep learning models for regulatory genomics data with domain-specific surrogate models. For installation instructions, tutorials, and documentation, please refer to the SQUID website, https://squid-nn.readthedocs.io/. For an extended discussion of this approach and its applications, please refer to our manuscript:

## Install:

```bash
pip install squid-nn
```

## Dependencies:

```bash
pip install logomaker
pip install mavenn --upgrade
```

### Notes

For issues installing MAVE-NN, please see:
- https://mavenn.readthedocs.io/en/latest/installation.html
- https://github.com/jbkinney/mavenn/issues

For older DNNs that require inference via Tensorflow 1.x, Python 2.x is required which is not supported by MAVE-NN. Users will need to create separate environments in this case:
1. Tensorflow 1.x and Python 2.x environment for generating *in silico* MAVE data
2. Tensorflow 2.x and Python 3.x environment for training MAVE-NN surrogate models


## Usage:
SQUID provides a simple interface that takes as input a sequence-based deep-learning model (e.g., a DNN), which is used as an oracle to generate an *in silico* MAVE dataset representing a localized region of sequence space. The MAVE dataset can then be fit using a domain-specific surrogate model, with the resulting parameters visualized to reveal the *cis*-regulatory mechanisms driving model performance.
