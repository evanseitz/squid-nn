SQUID: interpreting sequence-based deep learning models for regulatory genomics
===============================================================================

**SQUID** [#Seitz2023]_ (Surrogate Quantitative Interpretability for Deepnets) 
is a Python suite to interpret sequence-based deep learning models for 
regulatory genomics data with domain-specific surrogate models.
To learn more about this approach, please see our manuscript:

.. [#Seitz2023] Seitz E, McCandlish D, Kinney J, Koo P.
    Identifying *cis*-regulatory mechanisms from genomic deep neural networks using surrogate models. (2023).

SQUID is written for Python and is provided under an MIT open source license.
