SQUID: interpreting sequence-based deep learning models for regulatory genomics
===================================

**SQUID** [#Seitz2023]_ (Surrogate Quantitative Interpretability for Deepnets) 
is a Python suite to interpret sequence-based deep learning models for 
regulatory genomics data with domain-specific surrogate models.
To learn more about this approach, please see our manuscript:

.. [#Seitz2023] Seitz E, McCandlish D, Kinney J, Koo P.
    Identifying *cis*-regulatory mechanisms from genomic deep neural networks using surrogate models. (2023).

SQUID is written for Python and is provided under an MIT open source license. 
The documentation provided here is meant to help users quickly get SQUID working
for their own research needs. Please do not hesitate to contact us with any
