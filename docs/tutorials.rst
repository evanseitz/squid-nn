Modeling Tutorials
===================

Examples of applying SQUID on previously-published deep learning models can be found in the following notebooks.

    1. `Colab – Additive surrogate modeling <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/12HR8Vu_8ji3Ac1wli4wgqx1J0YB73JF_?usp=sharing>`_
    2. `Colab – Pairwise surrogate modeling <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1eKC78YE2l49mQFOlnA9Xr1Y9IO121Va5?usp=sharing>`_
    3. `Colab – Variant effect analysis <https://colab.research.google.com/drive/1wtpT1FF5nu1etTDOaV3A7ByXhuLqK071?usp=sharing>`_

.. note::

    Several Python scripts are also provided in the SQUID repository covering other (and some similar) examples.
